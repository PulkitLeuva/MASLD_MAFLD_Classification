## Overview

This repository contains two scripts developed for **binary classification** of steatotic liver diseases, namely **Metabolic Dysfunction‐Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)** and **Metabolic Dysfunction‐Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD)**.

## What are MAFLD and MASLD?

- **MAFLD**: A term introduced in 2020, defined by the presence of hepatic steatosis plus:
  - Overweight/obesity, or
  - Type 2 diabetes, or
  - Lean/normal weight with at least two metabolic dysregulations

- **MASLD**: The updated nomenclature introduced in 2023, replacing NAFLD and MAFLD. It refers to hepatic steatosis combined with **one or more cardiometabolic risk factors**.  
  Patients with additional alcohol intake are classified as **MetALD**.

The transition to MASLD reflects a move toward less stigmatizing and more precise medical terminology.
